🔐 User Management System with Keycloak Integration
I developed a secure and scalable User Management System by integrating Keycloak, an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution. The project utilizes Keycloak REST APIs to offload all user-related operations such as registration, login, update, and deletion.

Keycloak serves as the central authentication and authorization server, and all user data is stored in Keycloak's internal database. The application delegates user identity management to Keycloak to ensure standardized security protocols

🔧 Key Features & Technical Highlights:
🔐 Authentication & Authorization via Keycloak
Keycloak handles login workflows, password encryption, token generation, and role-based access control (RBAC).

⚙️ REST API Integration
All user operations (create, update, delete) are performed by securely consuming Keycloak’s REST endpoints.

🧾 JWT Token Generation
Upon successful login, Keycloak issues a JWT token, which is used by the application for stateless authentication in subsequent API requests.

🗃️ User Store in Keycloak Database
No custom user tables were required; all user details are stored and managed directly by Keycloak.

🚀 Seamless Integration with Spring Boot
The main application is built using Spring Boot and communicates securely with the Keycloak server for user management operations.

✅ Real-World Use Case:
This architecture is ideal for enterprise-grade applications that require centralized identity management, multi-tenant access control, and standard security compliance with minimal custom code.
